Syntax: SET PAGELENGTH <off or number of lines>

Page length controls how many lines of text are shown at a time. If there is more than the set page length, you can type MORE to page through them.

Note that this may exhibit unexpected behavior if word wrap is turned off.

The default is 20.

Example:

SET PAGELENGTH 30
