Syntax: ALIST [ATTRIB] [QUERY]

Lists objects which match this query. Not very powerful at the moment. ATTRIB is either 'class' or an object attribute like @name. If used by itself, ALIST lists all GameObjects, which can be fun.

Example: alist
Example: alist @generic plant
Example: alist class Dog
